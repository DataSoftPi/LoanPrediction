This project focused on creating a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier from scratch to predict the approval status of loans. 

The classifier was built in Python and was trained using a robust loan dataset that had undergone careful preprocessing to maximize its efficacy. The project explored the intricacies of the KNN algorithm, including its behavior in terms of time complexity and how this varied with changes in data size and dimensions. 
Extensive testing was conducted to determine the accuracy of the classifier. This undertaking provided valuable insights into machine learning algorithm development, data preprocessing, and performance evaluation, enhancing our understanding of the KNN algorithm.
